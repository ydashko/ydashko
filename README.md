### Hi there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/>

I'm [**Yaroslav**](), a software engineer based in Ukraine.

I like combining my technical knowledge with design to make beautiful and efficient applications. My goal is to build scalable and efficient software while providing engaging and flawless user experiences.

Outside of work, I do sports and read tech literature ( right now it`s Chip War: The Fight For The World's Most Critical Technology by Chris Miller ).


#### Additional Facts:
- I have a degree in dentistry.
- I do scale modeling/figure painting.
- I am a swimmer with 7 years of experience.
